The dataset is split into two parts: a training set (train.csv) and a test set (test.csv). Use the training set to build your machine learning models, which includes known outcomes (survival) and features (like gender and class). The test set is for predicting outcomes on unseen data. A sample submission file, gender_submission.csv.
